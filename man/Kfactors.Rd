\title{The Ten Kidera Factors
%%   ~~ data name/kind ... ~~
}
\description{
The Kidera Factors were originally derived by applying multivariate analysis to 188 physical properties of the 20 amino acids and using dimension reduction techniques. A 10-dimensional vector of orthogonal factors was then obtained for each amino acid.
