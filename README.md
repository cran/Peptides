Peptides
========
R package to calculate indices and theoretical physicochemical properties of peptides and protein sequences. Include also the option to read and plot output files from the GROMACS molecular dynamics package.

Install
-------
This package required R version 1.2.2 or higher. If you are using an older version of R you will be prompted to upgrade when you try to install the package.

The official release of Peptides is available on CRAN. To install from CRAN, use the following command:
```
install.packages("Peptides", dependencies=TRUE)
```
If you have devtools installed, install the latest stable version this package directly from GitHub:

```
library(devtools)
install_github("Peptides", "dosorio")
library(Peptides)
```
You can install the development version:
```
install_github("Peptides", "dosorio", "develop")
```
although it may not always work.
